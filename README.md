# Image Detection
Canny Edge Detection Algorithm Approach has been implemented to detect the edges of an Object(human, cars, trees etc..) within the Image.
This algorithm needs to be proceesed in three stages -<br>
(a) Noise reduction stage.<br>
(b) Detect the intensity Gradient within the Image.<br>
(c) Supression of Nonmaximum pixels.<br>
<br>
By implementing these three phases, we will be able to see a refined image with edges demarcating the features of the target object within the image.
OpenCV implementation of the same have been shown with an example.
